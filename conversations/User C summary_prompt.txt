You are provided with a large interview transcript and you must extract all the most important exchanges while removing irrelevant information. The interview is on the subject of user experience using the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. You must not change the actual contents of the conversation, only reduce the size to only include the most useful information. USE EXACT QUOTES.\nConversation transcript:\n"1\nSo basically I\'m working on the user experience side of digimap and we\'re still at the early stage, so I\'m \ntrying to identify the different user groups and their goals in terms of using.\n\nFor Penn.\n1\nYeah, freeze.\n\nSo are you.\n2\nInterested in you say in space.\n\nDesign or you put that.\n\nHere, broadly yes.\n3\nSo you\'re interested in interface design.\n1\nNot quite the design part yet.\n1\nSo we\'re just.\n1\nWe have looked at the log analysis part of it and then we\'re trying to have a qualitative.\n1\nInsights from like.\n1\nActual users who can tell us about their experience in terms of what functionality.\n1\nAre they mainly using?\n1\nIf that makes sense, it does.\n1\nSo yeah, personally, because I\'ve.\n1\nHad like a bit of reading on your profile page and I see that you\'re basically focusing on like data \nvisualization for maps and like generalization.\n\nThat\'s right.\n1\nSo I don\'t quite know a lot about geographic information system yet.\n1\nBut could you just tell me more about, like your focus?\n1\nWhat\'s your interesting research please?\n\nHang. We\'re gonna.\n3\nLet the kettle boil.\n3\nBecause that\'s too noisy.\n3\nI\'m interested.\n3\nIn the role that maps play.\n3\nIn in various tasks.\n3\nSo the task might be to climb to the top of a mountain.\n3\nOr the task might be to navigate to Scott\'s monument, right. And you can think of many different tasks it \nmight be trying to.\n3\nDesign AA plan for your holiday right? Or it might be to think about the best way to get to Glasgow from \nEdinburgh.\n3\nBut all of these require us to think about geography.\n3\nAnd often maps.\n3\nAre used as part of that process.\n3\nSo I\'m interested in the cognitive.\n3\nProcesses through which people reach to make decisions about those sorts of activities.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo it\'s more like the practical use of it instead of like research academic ways.\n3\nIf you like.\n1\nI mean yeah, because like from my perspective, did you map is mostly open to like for the education and \nhigher education.\n1\nSo for academic like research.\n1\nSo does that play in your like daily research?\n1\nSo like how what\'s like your typical scenario in using like digit maps side of maps?\n3\nUM, so I very rarely use digimap. OK Digimap is in my view. Yeah, a.\n3\nFiling cabinet.\n3\nIt\'s a filing cabinet and in the drawers of the filing cabinet is contained.\n3\nDifferent thematic.\n3\nData types, yes.\n3\nSo it provides Lidar gathered from remotely sensed technology.\n3\nIt contains geological data.\n3\nIt contains topographic data, so it contains a whole range of different.\n3\nData types and.\n3\nIt for different levels of detail, so different scales and at different levels of coverage, yes.\n3\nSo in that sense.\n3\nYou could argue that it\'s just like a filing cabinet, right?\n3\nAnd so for most people, I would imagine the context of use is that they have some project.\n3\nIt yes.\n3\nSo recently somebody wants to do a project looking at calculating the speed of humans walking up and \ndown hills.\n3\nOK, so when the hill gets steeper?\n3\nYou walk more slowly.\n3\nAnd so we can argue that there\'s a relationship between slope.\n3\nAnd or gradient right and speed, right?\n3\nYeah, there does come a point at which as people get to walk up something very steep, they start to \nzigzag.\n3\nRight.\n3\nAnd then they walk slower still.\n3\nSo this person needed very detailed 3 dimensional data.\n3\nSo they would go to digimap, they would go to the service provider, Edina and they would log on.\n3\nThey would generate an account.\n3\nThey would select the geographic area, which in our case was the pentlands.\n3\nAnd then they would download that data.\n1\nRight.\n1\nSo yeah, I see.\n1\nSo would that be mostly?\n1\nBecause we have a lot of collections within digimap, so we have ordinary survey, we have lighter as you \nmentioned we have like geographic information, what part like which collection.\n1\nDo you think it\'s like the most used one in terms of within the Department of Geoscience?\n3\nNo idea.\n1\nOh, OK.\n1\nSo what about you personally?\n1\nAlthough you said that you rarely use.\n2\nIt you never use it.\n3\nYeah, I never use it.\n3\nLike well, with the exception of this PhD student, OK.\n1\nSo for this particular project, then, like measuring the sleep of the health, what collection do you think \nhe was using or?\n3\nWell, there would be two there would be two places they could go to.\n\nThey were using.\n3\nSo Lidar will give you 3 dimensional data, right?\n3\nAnd also the Ordinance survey provides also its own height.\n3\nModel as well, so you could look at both of those.\n3\nOK, some of the height model data is collected at quite fine scale, right?\n3\nIn which case the data volumes are quite large and the data has to be interpreted carefully, and the \nordinance survey data it depending on how it\'s been stored.\n3\nAnd the resolution of the data will affect the data.\n3\nVolume and the way in.\n3\nWhich it\'s stored will also govern the type.\n3\nOf analysis that you want to perform on the database right on the data set, right?\n3\nSo the student might take both data sets and then they\'ll then import them into some kind of a \ninformation system like a like a GIS.\n3\nAnd they will start to analyse the data to see what kinds of things they can do with that data.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo it\'s mainly like at the beginning of the stage of the research that they\'re like coming into this and then \nget data and then they\'ll look at it like in another, probably another system and then like, do more \nanalysis elsewhere.\n3\nYes, it would be more than.\n3\nI don\'t think that.\n3\nDigimap provides any form of analysis.\n1\nRight.\n3\nNo, no, it\'s it\'s just like a filing cabinet.\n1\nOK.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo basically like you view the data, you download it and you transfer them elsewhere to do the analysis.\n3\nThen you say you\'d import it into a whole range of different pieces of software to analyze.\n3\nSo if you\'re interested in grade.\n3\nYou would first of.\n3\nAll have to you\'d need height information, yes.\n3\nSo you access LIDAR data and that will give you height and then you import it into a piece of GIS \nsoftware and it calculates gradient.\n3\nIt calculates aspect.\n3\nCalculates the area of a.\n3\nCatchment, right.\n3\nRight.\n3\nSo it\'s what you do with the data subsequently.\n3\nThat is the interesting part from a research point.\n3\nOf view.\n3\nOK, so did you map?\n\nLet\'s see.\n3\nYes is that\'s why I refer to it as a filing cabinet.\n3\nIt\'s it\'s.\n3\nIt\'s it is just that.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo so from my understanding so far you\'ve said so the major functionality that you\'re using is, first of all \nviewing and downloading.\n1\nSo what else?\n1\nIf you had any interaction with it, what else is your perception of this?\n1\nOther functionalities besides being a drawing cabinet that you might not using it now, but like you see \nthe potential of it to be.\n3\nI can\'t think of any, OK.\n2\nSo it is just a falling covenant.\n3\nYes, I can\'t see.\n3\nI couldn\'t see a context in which I\'d want it to be anything else.\n1\nOK.\n1\nAnd is this sufficient enough to just be a filing cabinet for you?\n1\nOK.\n3\nOK.\n3\nYeah, definitely.\n3\nI mean, if it was to be anything more than a filing cabinet.\n3\nThen it would simply be stepping on the toes of bespoke software that\'s already been built.\n3\nOhh I see.\n3\nSo for example, imagine if in digimap you could ask it.\n3\nTo calculate slope well, that\'s functionality that already exists in open source GIS systems, so it would be \na a duplication of of of functionality.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSee, so the.\n1\nFunctionality is necessary, but it could be achieved elsewhere and it\'s better to be elsewhere.\n1\nBecause it already does.\n3\nI think it\'s better to be some.\n3\nYeah, because let\'s imagine the digimap does enable you to calculate slope, right?\n3\nOr aspect uh.\n3\nWell, if you then wanted to that you would very quickly reach a point where it couldn\'t do a whole lot of \nother things, right that I could do if I had.\n1\nA GIS.\n1\nOK, so it\'s better to let them say.\n3\nYes, OK, yes, definitely.\n3\nI can\'t imagine you could invest time and effort.\n3\nIn increasing the functionality of.\n3\nDigi map but I can\'t imagine for one second that anybody would want.\n3\nTo utilize that functionality.\n2\nOK, I see.\n2\nI understand that.\n1\nSo you mentioned measuring.\n1\nSlope and we do have other than measuring slope, we have like the simple drawing tools and measuring \ntools for areas.\n1\nDo you think that is necessary and do you think it\'s good to use like?\n1\nDo you ever do you?\n1\nHave you ever used it and do you feel like it\'s handy?\n3\nI think in the context of, if you were a.\n3\nA school teacher.\n3\nRight.\n3\nAnd you had very little limited time and very limited space in the curriculum then maybe a school \nteacher would just simply say to the children we\'re today, we\'re going to.\n3\nLook at our school.\n3\nRight.\n3\nAnd we\'re going to download a map showing you the.\n3\nArea around the school.\n3\nAnd we\'re going to measure, we\'re going to show how you can use the computer to measure distances, \nand then we\'re going to go out into the playground and we\'re going to measure the distances using a \ntape measure.\n3\nAnd we can see if the computer is.\n3\nRight, right, right.\n3\nSo I think in in there would be context, some educational context in which.\n3\nIn which?\n3\nSchools would utilize digimap.\n1\nRight.\n3\nMore than just a filing cabinet, they would use it for that for using that kind of analysis.\n1\nI see.\n3\nBut I would never in a practical if I was running a practical for students here at the university, I would \nnever say to them or experiment using the functionality.\n3\nThat\'s available through digimap.\n3\nI\'d say to them.\n3\nRight.\n3\nGrab the data you need and then just import it into arc.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo for like, how would you draw the distinction?\n1\nBecause you mentioned school versus like in research and undergraduates be able to like use that?\n1\nOr is it better for them as well to import it to Arcgis?\n3\nYou want?\n3\nThat\'s interesting question.\n3\nMany schools are now being offered at GIS as a free educational support tools.\n3\nSo I guess increasingly even within a school environment, they wouldn\'t even bother to use the \nfunctionality that\'s provided through digital.\n1\nWow. OK, that\'s.\n3\nBecause they would have free software that was specially designed to enable you to do those kind of \nthings and many, many, many, many other things as well.\n1\nOK.\n1\nI see. I see.\n3\nSo I think in a limited context where you just wanted to do something very simple, you just wanted to \njust there\'s real value in this.\n3\nBut if you.\n3\nJust want to print a map out then.\n3\nDigimap would be perfectly good for that.\n1\nOK, I see.\n1\nOK, thank you.\n1\nAnd so.\n1\nJust wanted to double check this because you said that you don\'t really use digimap, but have you ever \nlike put out an assignment for students for your undergraduate students, for example to like a task or in \na lab to let them do a task in digimap?\n3\nOther than other other than saying to them, here\'s a filing cabinet and all you have to do is just pull on \nthe little that there\'s a little thing there.\n3\nYou just pull on that and the the drawer will open.\n3\nOK, so I wouldn\'t bother to spend any time on that.\n3\nI\'d say Digimap is a fantastic.\n3\nResource and it\'s a great place for being able to.\n3\nFind the data that you might need for your dissertation projects.\n\nRight.\n3\nSo I would more just sort of point them at the filing cabinet and I\'d say it\'s pretty easy to use.\n3\nYou just put your fingers under the drawer and so I wouldn\'t devote much time to.\n3\nIt to explain to them.\n3\nI see that it\'s pretty intuitive, I would argue, so I wouldn\'t need to set them an assignment.\n3\nTo say, practice opening and closing the.\n1\nWow, that\'s really interesting because we had interviewed the day before and she was like a student in \narchitecture, yeah.\n1\nAnd she actually found it, like, really hard to get.\n1\nGet started to using it.\n1\nAnd it\'s interesting that you would think that it\'s really intuitive instead of like you have to figure it out \nbefore you can actually use it.\n3\nI really understand what you\'re asking.\n3\nYeah. So the the.\n3\nDifference would be that the architect does has no exposure to geography, spatial modelling, spatial \nanalysis, the use of software that\'s specific to using.\n3\nTo analyzing geographic data.\n3\nRight.\n3\nShe probably would have little they would probably have very little understanding of notions of scale \nand concepts of mapping, of satellite imagery, and how it varied from vector based ordinance survey.\n3\nSo there\'s a whole load of missing pieces in in her puzzle.\n3\nI see.\n3\nSo I think in those contexts.\n3\nFor her to just simply open up digimap.\n3\nIt is going to be something where you just go.\n3\nWow, I don\'t.\n3\nKnow what any of these buttons mean?\n3\nI don\'t know what these icons mean.\n3\nI don\'t know why I have to select an area or something.\n3\nI don\'t understand why it seems.\n3\nTo be available.\n3\nAt different scales.\n3\nWhy is that?\n3\nWhy isn\'t there just one scale?\n3\nIt doesn\'t seem to cover the whole country for some data sets.\n3\nWhat? Why is that?\n3\nSo I think enormous complexity would be apparent to somebody that had nothing that had no \ngeography.\n3\nWhereas here we\'ve got undergraduates that are looking at this stuff at a level and then they right from \nthe very first courses they run, we\'re expecting them to handle maps, to understand how the \ninformation they contain, to interpret that information.\n3\nAnd they\'re exposed to using particular pieces of software.\n3\nSome of them are.\n3\nRelated to GIS and we run them through practicals so when they come to use.\n3\nEdina Digimap then they have a preconceived ideas which more or less fit.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo within like the geography realm of like maps and softwares, did you map is fairly consistent and \nintuitive as like?\n3\nIntuitive is a strong word.\n3\nIt\'s it\'s what was I trying to do the other day?\n3\nI I don\'t know.\n3\nI was trying to send a I was.\n3\nTrying to.\n3\nI don\'t know, I\'ll.\n3\nGive you an example.\n3\nI\'m I\'ve bought something and I now want to send it back.\n3\nAnd I go and click on the website and I know where can I find a a menu item that enables me to know \nhow to send this item back.\n3\nI just look and look and look and then it says contact, but there\'s nothing under there.\n3\nAnd it has a help.\n3\nI think that\'ll be the one to click on help.\n3\nYes, I need help and it goes.\n3\nYes, if you need help read this document.\n3\nYou know and it tells you about the interface, but it doesn\'t actually help you.\n3\nSo then sometimes things are deliberately obscured depending upon the ambition of the designer.\n1\nI see.\n3\nAnd then sometimes they what they think is very intuitive.\n3\nIs actually very.\n3\nDifficult to understand, the university has invested millions in a new system called people and money.\n3\nHave you heard?\n2\nOf it not really sorry.\n3\nSo people and money enables you to record when you\'re on holiday, what skills you\'re developing to \nlook at your accounts to.\n3\nOhh, it just covers everything, but when I go and I won\'t show you the interface, but when you see the \ninterface I just stare at it and I all I want to do.\n1\nOK.\n3\nIs what I want to do.\n3\nI was going on training to learn how.\n3\nTo be a.\n3\nFire warden, OK.\n3\nAnd I and I had scheduled this event and I said, oh, I wonder where it\'s taking place, right?\n3\nAnd I.\n3\nHad scheduled the event through people and money, so I thought, well, it must be there and I was \nclicking on all these different things.\n3\nI didn\'t know whether it was under personal skills or whether it was under events.\n3\nI thought ohh events and I clicked on events and it was telling me about all these things going on in the \nunit.\n3\nAnd it took me, I think, about half an hour to.\n3\nWork out.\n3\nWow, that\'s the ohh it\'s dreadful.\n3\nIt\'s an awful system.\n3\nBut anyway, it\'s the whole challenge of interface design.\n3\nIs for me it wasn\'t intuitive, but am I going to spend time using people and money?\n3\nNo, I\'ve got better things to do with my life.\n3\nI just need to get.\n3\nOn so it.\n3\nDidn\'t tell me what I wanted, so I just swore and then I just.\n3\nYou know, look back through my emails or I think I emailed a friend.\n\nOK.\n3\nI said, are you going to this training?\n3\nAnd they said yes, I said.\n3\nOhh great, where is it?\n3\nAnd they.\n3\nWent ohh yeah, I tried to find out as well.\n1\nSo sometimes it could be overcomplicated that is unnecessary and going to the.\n2\nWell, that\'s an.\n3\nInteresting question too, because the greater the functionality of something inherently the it\'s greater, \nthe greater its complexity.\n3\nSo Digimap is wonderfully simple.\n3\nBut it has very limited functionality.\n1\nI see.\n3\nAnd that\'s the trade off.\n3\nIsn\'t it?\n3\nRight.\n3\nIf you you you could, I guess design A spaceship that just.\n3\nHad one button.\n3\nSo they\'re all sitting there, right?\n3\nAnd the rocket is about to take off, and it\'s about to go.\n3\nTo Mars and they could have one great big huge.\n3\nButton, you know? And they could sit there and the guy goes 54321 and.\n3\nThe astronaut goes, you know, and this thing just rumbles out of the sky and and heads off to Mars.\n3\nAnd you\'d say, well, this is the best interface ever.\n3\nIt\'s really easy to use.\n3\nYou just.\n3\nPress that button.\n3\nDon\'t do anything else.\n3\nYou can\'t do anything else.\n3\nPress that button and it will take you to Mars.\n3\nBut we know that we can\'t do that because going.\n3\nTo Mars is a.\n3\nMulti stage process.\n3\nIt takes months.\n3\nYou need to use the toilet.\n3\nThere\'s just all sorts of.\n3\nReally complex interactions that need to take place and so to train an astronaut.\n3\nTakes years.\n3\nBut you can\'t.\n3\nYou can\'t take me and say [name] just sitting there.\n3\nAnd when I count to one hit that button.\n3\nSo you can\'t simplify the task of interacting with the system if it\'s inherently complex, so the same \nchallenge is with digimap that you can\'t just expect people to waltz into a geographical database and \ntreat it as if it\'s just like a filing cabinet.\n1\nI see.\n3\nYou first of all that architectural student is a lovely example.\n3\nWe\'re not going to do this, but I would need to sit with her.\n3\nMaybe we met up for a few weeks and I explained to her about scale, about granularity, about vectors, \nabout rasters, about.\n3\nGeographic extent about coordinate systems about.\n3\nSpherical coordinate systems, which is longitude and latitude.\n3\nPeople often think they\'re grid coordinates, but they\'re not, so I\'d have to arm this student with all of \nthese fundamental concepts.\n3\nI see because Digimap is not.\n3\nA big red button.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo if I could say this, if I could make this comparison so you would think within Department of \ngeography?\n1\nSo with the knowledge of geography, digimap is more like a vertical product where it just does one \nthing, but then for other department for the architectural student it could be like a horizontal product.\n1\nWhere it has like expanded feature of the details that she didn\'t necessarily know before coming to the \nmaps.\n3\nI suppose I\'m arguing differently.\n3\nI\'m arguing that.\n3\nThe most beautifully designed interface.\n3\nCannot be a substitute for.\n3\nA deeper understanding of the concepts that lie behind.\n3\nThat system.\n1\nI see.\n3\nYou can\'t get away from having to.\n3\nTrain your astronaut.\n3\nNo matter how good your interface is.\n3\nYou couldn\'t make such.\n3\nA brilliant interface that I could climb into that spaceship with no knowledge of how to fly it with.\n3\nWe haven\'t got the red button anymore, but we have a whole load of drop down menus and they\'d tell \nyou all about what to do, but I would just be sitting there going through hundreds of menus and I\'d have \nto learn.\n3\nOhh it says here I can choose.\n3\nDifferent scales.\n3\nThere\'s a button that says scale.\n3\nWhat is it?\n3\nWell, it\'s now turning into an educational tool.\n3\nIt\'s having to then teach me.\n3\nAll about scale.\n1\nI see. I see.\n3\nSo I can\'t see how an interface can overcome.\n3\nJust as if I was to walk into a lecture in architecture and start talking about architecture, they\'d say \n[name].\n3\nNo, no, no.\n3\nNo, no, no, no.\n3\nNo, you you don\'t know.\n3\nWhat you\'re talking about, and I\'d go.\n3\nOhh yeah, that\'s right, I don\'t.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo you think a tool is, so the knowledge behind it is necessary, but it doesn\'t affect how good the tool is \nbecause you will have to learn the knowledge to use the tool in the 1st place anyway.\n3\nYeah, yeah. I mean, what\'s?\n3\nShe gonna.\n3\nSo let\'s imagine that she manages.\n3\nTo download this data from.\n3\nOr what\'s she going to?\n3\nDo with it.\n1\nWell, she hasn\'t she.\n1\nWell from the interview so far, she said that all that she needed to do was just print the map out instead \nof downloading the data.\n\nAll right.\n1\nSo that was hard enough for her, obviously so.\n3\nIt would be, yeah.\n3\nBig, big, big.\n3\nEven something as simple as printing out a map.\n3\nWhat\'s its geographic extent?\n3\nAre you going to stick?\n3\nIt on a piece.\n3\nOf paper or.\n3\nAre you going to stick it on a piece of paper the size of that table, right?\n3\nWhat\'s the context of use?\n3\nAre you taking it on a?\n3\nBoat out to sea.\n3\nAre you going to make it waterproof?\n3\nAre you going to use it to navigate by?\n3\nWhat if it doesn\'t show the names of mountains?\n3\nDoes that matter?\n3\nOh my God, there are so many questions that you\'d need to answer to the simple question of make me \na map.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo you think that Digimap is capable to have that functionality of like such detailed selections of what \nyou want to?\n1\nBe on the map.\n3\nNo, it doesn\'t have that.\n3\nWe gotta be careful about the word functionality.\n3\nI think it\'s not so much that it has that functionality.\n3\nIt provides you an affordance.\n3\nIt provides you the means by which.\n3\nYou can access data.\n1\nI see.\n3\nSo if I want to access data at a particular scale then it will present me with an overview of the map and \nthen allow me to draw a marquee.\n3\nSo I guess you could call that functionality, but it\'s really allowing the person to intuitively say.\n3\nI want that bit.\n1\nI see.\n3\nIt won\'t let you do.\n3\nI want that bit.\n3\nIt always generates a square.\n3\nYeah, it works in squares, but if you want to just, you know, if you, if you sort of said I want a map of \nEdinburgh.\n3\nBut without the sea in it.\n3\nYou can\'t do that.\n3\nOh, you can\'t.\n1\nMap, I thought.\n1\nYou should like select layers of your own.\n3\nYou can select layers, you can select layers, yes, but it\'s always going to give you.\n3\nOutput in a square.\n3\nIt\'s going to ask you to define the top left and the bottom right.\n1\nOK.\n1\nOK.\n1\nOK.\n3\nBut it doesn\'t enable you if you ask, you can\'t say.\n3\nTo it, you can\'t talk.\n3\nTo it, you can\'t.\n3\nSo you could sit there, a really intuitive interface would be to say, uh, I\'d like a map showing buildings \nthat are within half a mile of my house.\n1\nAnd then it just does.\n3\nIt why not?\n1\nI see.\n3\nIt but it doesn\'t let you do.\n3\nThat does it it. Yeah.\n2\nNo, definitely not yet.\n3\nYou\'d have to choose the layout you\'d have to.\n3\nYou\'d have to define where.\n3\nYour house was.\n3\nYou\'d have to draw a square.\n3\nYou wouldn\'t let you do a circle, and it would probably give you a whole lot of other data that you didn\'t \nwant.\n1\nBut would you say it\'s a trade off that allows you to select so many things?\n3\nYeah, every interface is a trade.\n1\nOther persons OK.\n3\nOff it\'s a trade off between the simplicity and ease of use and being.\n3\nAble to support.\n3\nAnd being able to support complex query is.\n3\nBut if you make the query complex, then the functionality or the.\n3\nThe affordance of the technology increases rapidly.\n3\nSo suddenly instead of.\n3\nIf you wanted to select if you wanted to say I want a map that includes buildings but doesn\'t include \nstreet names, well now you\'re having to put together a complex spatial query, and for that you need \nSQL.\n3\nOr some kind of language.\n3\nOr some interface that enables you to say, please give me buildings but don\'t give me street names.\n3\nI see that\'s very hard.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo there was actually another architectural student who mentioned the similar things.\n1\nSo basically she, uh, I mean, he was trying to select only like the point of interest for education points.\n1\nSo colleges.\n1\nBut then it couldn\'t let him do that because education is tied to.\n1\nSo would you think it should be more specified?\n1\nI know like for more specified selections you have to like put more effort into curating it, but do you \nthink now As for the overlays and the things they can select to be in there?\n1\nIs it like over integrated?\n1\nOr does it need to be like?\n3\nWe\'re coming back.\n3\nTo that same problem that effectively you\'re starting to.\n3\nQuestions that you can do so much more easily in a GIS software.\n3\nI see.\n3\nSo I would just.\n3\nTake all of that data.\n3\nLet\'s imagine their area of interest was education in Edinburgh.\n3\nWell, I would just download the topographic map sheet that covered Edinburgh.\n3\nIt would include the level of attribution that showed.\n3\nWhere schools were and and then I.\n3\nWould just filter it.\n3\nOnce it was inside the GIS software.\n1\nI see.\n3\nSo I wouldn\'t be bothering to filter it.\n3\nWithin Digimap, it\'s just a nightmare.\n3\nWell, it doesn\'t exist so, but even if it did exist.\n3\nAll you\'re starting to do is duplicate.\n3\nSo the nice thing about a filing cabinet is we know what the filing cabinet does.\n3\nYou can see from its functionality that I can lock it, that\'s handy.\n3\nAnd you can see that I\'m able to store documents in it and I\'m able to order those documents and I\'m \nable to put a little label so I know what is in each document.\n3\nAnd I I don\'t want a filing cabinet that that has an alarm.\n3\nOr tells me what the time is.\n3\nI got that I don\'t want a filing cabinet that says, oh, have you read this or or a filing cabinet that says?\n3\nI I can produce 50 different versions of this article by using pivot tables in Excel I go no.\n3\nNo, no, no, no, no, just just, just just.\n3\nJust be a filing cabinet.\n1\nI see.\n2\nThank you.\n3\nYou know?\n3\nDon\'t overcook it.\n3\nCause I\'ve got excel on this machine and I\'ve got scissors.\n3\nIf I want to cut up an article and and I\'ve got.\n3\nA watch so.\n3\nTo let\'s keep it simple and I think the filing cabinet in its simple form is accessible to more people.\n3\nAnd if you do, try.\n3\nAnd get it to do anything more.\n3\nLike tell you the time?\n3\nWell, it\'s functionality that probably most people don\'t.\n1\nNeed I see?\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo I\'m thinking that you think it\'s good already just to be a filing cabinet, but you haven\'t like?\n1\nCause every problem that it can\'t solve it can be done elsewhere and it\'s.\n3\nBetter done elsewhere, yeah.\n1\nOK.\n1\nSo have you like had any difficulties in using the filing cabinet itself alone?\n1\nSo is there any time that you couldn\'t?\n1\nLike it didn\'t.\n1\nEven meet the function of a filing cabinet.\n3\nGood question.\n3\nNo, it it it just.\n3\nIt just does what it needs to do.\n1\nOK.\n3\nYeah, and and to that end, it\'s it\'s great.\n1\nSo you don\'t think?\n1\nLike there\'s no, there\'s no necessary points of to improve as it to be a filing cabinet, so it\'s good so far as \nthe filing cabinet.\n3\nWas a good question.\n3\nI was thinking about, let\'s say you imagined, let\'s say you identified different user communities, so you \nidentified school teachers.\n3\nWho else could there be?\n3\nThe general public?\n3\nRight.\n3\nLet\'s imagine anybody could access.\n3\nDid you map?\n3\nAnd academics.\n3\nSo you design the interface and the first question the interface asks you is, are you a teacher or are you \nthe general public?\n3\nOr are you an academic?\n3\nAnd and then the filing cabinet, I guess.\n3\nI\'m not keen on this idea, but the filing cabinet could could.\n3\nIts interface right to fit these different communities.\n1\nWe\'re actually working towards that because there\'s about four, yeah.\n3\nYes, I I thought you were.\n3\nYes, yes.\n3\nSo I guess you could.\n1\nDo that. OK, so for.\n3\nI don\'t.\n3\nI don\'t like it, but I understand your motivation.\n1\nBut we actually have different products already, so there\'s the demand for schools.\n1\nDid you?\n1\nThis is digimap for higher education and I think there\'s gonna be a digimap pro for like commercial \npurposes.\n1\nOK.\n1\nBut for within the higher education alone, what problems do you see if there is any?\n1\nAs it being a file jar.\n3\nWell, because uh, it\'s not a it comes back.\n3\nOh no, I can\'t.\n3\nTalk about that it it.\n3\nIt depends how.\n3\nDistinct those 3 communities are and I don\'t think that they are as distinct as we would imagine them to \nbe.\n1\nI see.\n3\nLet\'s imagine, for example, that you had [name].\n3\nWith his fingers.\n3\nAnd you had somebody else that had no arms.\n3\nThen you would say that these in terms of interacting with the filing cabinet, these are two very \ndifferent people for the person with no arms, we\'re going to have to design A filing cabinet that\'s maybe \noperated through a series of pedals.\n3\nMaybe you have pedals 123 and four and you press pedal 4 and it opens drawer #4.\n3\nSo what you\'ve done is you\'ve designed an interface specifically addressing the needs of that individual \nwho doesn\'t have the dexterity that I have.\n3\nSo we can see real logic in that.\n3\nBut what you\'re arguing?\n3\nWell, what\'s implicit in what you\'ve just said is that you have a school teacher and you have the general \npublic, or you have a commercial entity or you have a academic, but in reality.\n3\nSomebody who is, say, a commercial entity.\n3\nMay have just the same knowledge and expertise and time available, and also wants just to make a map \nas the.\n3\nSchool teacher does.\n3\nSo maybe the commercial person is better off just clicking on.\n3\nI\'m a teacher because they get a really easy to use interface.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo it\'s not necessary.\n3\nSo how distinct are the?\n3\nThere\'s different communities of people.\n3\nWhat makes you think they are so different?\n3\nMaybe the researcher.\n3\nJust wants a.\n3\nReally simple map, because they\'re going to conduct a survey and they want to be able to show people \nvery quickly.\n3\nWhere the fish?\n3\nFarm is so they just want a.\n3\nReal simple map fish farm in the middle of the picture.\n3\nAnd the buildings and they want to be able to say you live just here, the fish farm is going to be here.\n3\nHow do you think it will impact on your life?\n3\nSo well for that they may.\n3\nAs well, just.\n3\nHave clicked on.\n3\nI\'m a teacher.\n3\nGive me something real simple.\n3\nI think teacher equals simple because it doesn\'t.\n3\nI know teachers that have a very sophisticated understanding of GIS and and use GIS in a way that\'s far \nmore sophisticated than at university level.\n3\nSo these classifications are premised on the idea that these are homogeneous groups.\n3\nAnd that they are distinct and I think they\'re neither.\n1\nSo it doesn\'t depend on the community identity, but it depends on their specific tasks and goals they\'re \ntrying to achieve with the system.\n3\nI would say.\n3\nSo then you end up with an interface where you have to ask 50 questions before you can decide what \ninterface to give them.\n3\nYes, exactly so you say.\n3\nAre you this?\n3\nDo you have hands do.\n3\nYou have knowledge of, you know you end up.\n3\nIt\'s it\'s 50 questions before you can say, OK, the interface will now present itself to me.\n2\nI see.\n1\nSo what would you say is the most important range of tasks in?\n1\nHigher education setting.\n1\nFor example, we\'re breaking down into the tasks now instead of like the community, and but we still \nhave to, like, do it in steps so that every community\'s task is like covered.\n1\nIf that makes any.\n3\nSense. No, that\'s crazy.\n1\nNo, I\'m trying not.\n1\nI\'m not trying to like branch it out to like those specifics.\n1\nI\'m trying to like pinpoint or trying to get at the idea of like the end goals of users so.\n1\nLike for you personally, what is your most ultimate goal besides downloading the data?\n1\nBecause I sense that it is one of the important goals that you\'re trying to achieve.\n3\nWell, I don\'t expect it to do anything other than enable me to download data.\n1\nOK.\n1\nSo that\'s basically the most case, just to download it.\n\nYeah, that\'s.\n3\nThat\'s all there.\n3\nIs, yeah, but you can\'t say just.\n3\nYou can\'t use that word.\n3\nJust I think you said it would be just to download it.\n3\nThe word dust suggests that it\'s either limited or.\n3\nIs easy to do, but as we know from the architectural student, the word just is not appropriate.\n1\nI see.\n3\nIt\'s incredibly difficult.\n3\nI see.\n3\nSo, so I the the I think.\n3\nThe the broader.\n3\nIs the degree to which technology?\n3\nIn this case, facilitates access to data where the user community is very broad and has very diverse.\n3\nRequirements and very varying levels of knowledge and so in that sense I suppose you design an \ninterface that is kind of at the lowest common denominator.\n3\nIt\'s working at the simplest level, so it doesn\'t actually accommodate people that have got no arms.\n1\nRight.\n1\nRight.\n3\nIt just for the majority of people.\n3\nEnables you to.\n3\nOpen the drawer with your.\n3\nFingers and to gain access to the data that you need.\n1\nRight, so friendly to all at the most.\n1\nSorry, like it should be something that is friendly to everyone.\n3\nWell, that\'s my point.\n3\nI don\'t think it can.\n1\nBe I mean the.\n3\nMost we\'re back to the argument around the we we\'re back to the argument about the astronaut.\n1\nYeah, right.\n3\nYeah, you know that that, that, that, that you can make it as simple as you like and just have a simple \nred button that they have to press.\n3\nBut the reality is that the nature of the task.\n3\nMeans that that\'s not sufficient.\n\nI see.\n3\nAnd if you were to try and design the interface for for many different users that accommodated all the \nrange of users.\n3\nThen this can become a.\n3\nAnd then you start to create something that is inherently or fundamentally complex.\n3\nComplexity arises from trying to handle exceptions and deal with what if?\n3\nSo in my rather silly example, you know what if the person does not have arms?\n3\nOK, we need to give them this interface.\n3\nNow that\'s a very simplistic example, but you can imagine, well, all of that\'s going to depend upon what \nwhat\'s the nature of the task.\n3\nDo they know what they want?\n3\nIs a very interesting question, so that you\'ll see lots of well written papers around.\n3\nOhh, don\'t ask the user.\n3\nI\'ve been to so many conferences where people say, oh, don\'t ask the user.\n3\nThey don\'t know what they want.\n1\nI I mean, from my perspective, it\'s the most important thing to ask the user what they want so that you \nare not trying to like build something that is in your head that is not practical to anyone who\'s trying to \nuse it.\n3\nI don\'t agree with you.\n3\nOhh, not at all.\n3\nNo, you\'re.\n3\nI think the all of your ideas and all of your research is premised on the notion that user knows best.\n3\nI don\'t think I think Socrates argued that the.\n3\nThat that\'s blatantly untrue.\n3\nDo you know what\'s best for you?\n1\nWell, I can\'t certainly see some problems while I\'m using something, so I would like have specific \nsuggestions.\n1\nIf I were like using it for like I don\'t know a month.\n3\nDo you think? Yeah.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n3\nNo, I I think it\'s I I I.\n3\nObviously respect your position, but I.\n3\nThink it\'s flawed.\n1\nOhh OK.\n3\nDoes I?\n3\nEven taking the example of your architectural student, do they know what they want?\n1\nRight.\n1\nDownloading maps I guess.\n3\nDo what and why do they want to?\n1\nDo that well practically, because they\'re like they\'re told to do.\n1\nThere\'s assignment that yes.\n3\nOhh Blimey.\n3\nYeah, right.\n3\nSo yeah, I think you\'ve definitely agreed with me.\n3\nOn that one then.\n3\nOhh OK you they don\'t know what they want and they don\'t know how.\n3\nTo do it, and they wouldn\'t know how to design an interface, you\'d say, well, how do you want the \ninterface to look?\n3\nAnd they\'d go.\n3\nWhat you\'d say the interface, how do you?\n3\nWant it to look and they\'d say easy.\n3\nOK.\n3\nDo you want to do?\n3\nDo you want to be able to?\n3\nChoose a square map.\n3\nDo you want your?\n3\nMap to be square they go.\n3\nSo all you do is you\'d give them a whole set of things and eventually.\n3\nThey they\'d say.\n3\nYeah, I like that.\n1\nSo you think it should be a top down approach instead of like focusing on specific problems that people \nhad.\n1\nSorry, I feel like we\'re really getting.\n2\nInto the philosophical part of so.\n3\nWe are getting we we are.\n3\nGetting to the.\n\nPhilosophical. So so.\n2\nSorry, I didn\'t mean to.\n3\nNo, no, no, I mean it\'s.\n2\nBe going to this direction.\n3\nEven if we look.\n3\nEven if we look here, I.\n3\nI don\'t so so this is this is what people use now as a mouse.\n3\nI use this this this graphical user interface.\n3\nYeah, but.\n3\nBefore the mouse came along.\n3\nI don\'t.\n3\nI don\'t think anybody ever said or what I\'d like is an arrow that I can move anywhere on the screen and \nI\'d like it that I could operate it through my hand.\n1\nNobody ever said that.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo nothing.\n1\nReally can be wanted until it\'s like innovative.\n3\nI think you have to say.\n3\nThese people this is.\n3\nA mouse and they go what?\n3\nAnd then you say, OK, try moving it around and they\'d go.\n3\nOK.\n3\nAnd then you say right now, now look what happens when.\n3\nYou click on.\n3\nIt you go.\n3\nOK, hang on.\n3\nOh, OK.\n3\nAnd it says password.\n3\nSo type in your password.\n3\nHow do I do that?\n3\nWell, you do that.\n3\nUse a keyboard so none of these things are they they haven\'t been in response to a user community that \nhas said you know what we really need is a mouse and a keyboard and a big screen.\n3\nNone of that, that all of that has just come from people experimenting with ideas and the graphical user \ninterface, of course, has all has a whole set of constraints, but it\'s intuitive.\n3\nWell, it it\'s it\'s intuitive only to people that have had exposure or seen people using computers.\n3\nYou know, there\'s there\'s there\'s a 20 million, 20 billion people in India that have never made a phone \ncall in their lives.\n3\nSo the notion of what\'s intuitive and what is easy to use is premised on a whole set of.\n3\nPrior experience?\n3\nYes, exactly.\n3\nAnd that\'s what\'s enabled this to become so popular.\n3\nSo what\'s happened is people have come to use this.\n3\nAnd which has done away with this and this.\n3\nAnd now we are well.\n3\nWe sort of have a keypad, a pod pad.\n3\nAnd now, now the fingers touch the screen and so now we pinch and zoom.\n3\nSo pinch and you know this.\n3\nFeels like a very intuitive thing to do and now.\n3\nYou see children?\n3\nLooking at magazines and.\n3\nTrying to pitch them to pinch them.\n\nRight.\n3\nSo we borrow in fascinating ways and and and employ our understanding.\n3\nAnd now what\'s happening is peoples use of mobile phones is raising their Computer literacy and that \nthen impacts.\n3\nHow they then see the relationship between these two devices and how they come to use computers?\n1\nI see.\n3\nBut I don\'t think people ever ask the users.\n2\nOK, that\'s the interesting point.\n2\nI\'ve never, yeah.\n3\nBut the notion of user.\n3\nKnows best is, is, is, is.\n3\nVacuous. Rather strong word.\n1\nI see, yeah.\n3\nSo I know all about maps and I know how complex they are.\n3\nSo as an expert, I think I would be better able to design an interface that.\n3\nPeople would intuitively be able to learn how to use I.\n3\nSo in other words, I wouldn\'t say to people, well, you\'re going to have to specify in latitude and \nlongitude a top left and a bottom right.\n3\nI wouldn\'t get people to to specify these coordinates, although there\'s plenty of systems where you \nused to have to do that, and then I will draw a square based on top left and bottom right and that will be \nyour region.\n3\nMost people don\'t know about spherical coordinates.\n3\nThey don\'t even know that latitude and longitude is a meaningful way of representing space on the \nsurface of the Earth.\n3\nSo what I would much rather do is simply present them.\n3\nSo this is my computer screen.\n3\nI would present them first.\n3\nI\'ll give them a plus and A minus to zoom in and out and then I\'ll give them a simple mouse operated \ninstruction where they click, hold down the mouse and they just draw a square over the area that once.\n3\nIt will capture that area, it will colour it red so they know that\'s the area of interest.\n3\nI\'ll come back with a question that says, is this the?\n3\nArea you want.\n3\nAnd they click on either yes or no.\n3\nIf they say no, then they\'re allowed another go.\n3\nIf they click yes, it exports it in a shape file.\n3\nAnd this shape file enables them to import it into Arcgis and they\'re happy bunnies.\n1\nWow, OK.\n3\nBut I can\'t imagine that a user is.\n3\nIf I if I then sat 50 people in front of that and I said, does this work for you?\n3\nTheir their answers might be.\n3\nI I don\'t really like it.\n3\nWell, is that my fault or is that because they have no understanding of maps?\n3\nOr do they find that it\'s not intuitive to draw us a marquee, or why have they said what they\'ve said?\n3\nDo they know what?\n3\nWhat would they suggest?\n3\nSay OK, well, you didn\'t like [name]’s interface.\n3\nHe\'ll be very upset, but what would you suggest as a, as an alternative?\n3\nAnd they might say, well, actually, all I want to do is I want to be able to type in the word Edinburgh.\n3\nI don\'t.\n3\nI don\'t like this stuff so.\n3\nI just want to be able to type in Edinburgh and it will then produce a map with Edinburgh at its center.\n3\nSo then, so you go OK, we can do that.\n3\nSo now you\'ve got two modes.\n3\nYou can either interact through [name]’s interface and draw a marquee, or you can interact through \nnamed extent and you can type in the word Edinburgh.\n3\nSo now you\'ve just got two ways of.\n3\nAccessing the data.\n3\nThe problem we\'ve got now is you\'ve got a map.\n3\nWith Edinburgh in the middle.\n3\nBut I don\'t know whether you want this to be a 1 to 500 scale. Very very detailed, or whether you want \nit at one to half million because you want to use the map to travel to Glasgow so.\n3\nI\'m gonna have to ask them another question.\n3\nNot where do you want the map to be centered on?\n3\nWhich is Edinburgh.\n3\nOK, got that.\n3\nBut I now know I want to now know what.\n3\nWhat detail do you want to show it at?\n3\nAnd people don\'t understand scale and they don\'t understand that.\n3\nWhat do you mean?\n3\nWhat detail?\n3\nSo do you want to?\n3\nSee buildings and.\n3\nThey go, oh, I\'d love to see buildings you say.\n3\nOK.\n3\nSo I\'ll I\'ll zoom in and now you.\n3\nCan see lots.\n3\nOf buildings and what do you want to use it for?\n3\nWell, I want to use it because I\'m thinking of travelling to Glasgow.\n3\nYou know well, you can\'t do.\n3\nNo, you can\'t do that.\n3\nBut you this is far too detailed.\n3\nIf you want to travel to Glasgow, you\'re gonna need a much bigger map at a much smaller scale.\n3\nWhat do you mean, smaller scale?\n3\nOhh alright, let\'s think about this in terms of.\n3\nSo you what do you wanna do?\n3\nYou wanna go from Edinburgh to Glasgow?\n3\nYes, please.\n3\nOK.\n3\nCan I do here Edinburgh to Glasgow?\n3\nImagine you wanted to design them well.\n3\nI suppose it would be to see if I could somehow write an algorithm where you\'d typed in, oh, a bit like \nGoogle Maps.\n3\nYou know how it says from and to.\n1\nYes, and it shows you the one.\n3\nThere you go.\n3\nSo that\'s it.\n3\nSo we\'ll have now a task based activity.\n3\nSo no longer are we asking for a map with Edinburgh its centre, but basically what you\'re now wanting \nto do is to go from AH, Now I can do it now that enables me to generate a map and this time we can see \nthe two cities and we can see the routes that you can take.\n3\nYou can go this way by train.\n3\nThis by car or you could walk.\n3\nOr you could cycle.\n3\nWhy are you interested in any of these?\n3\nNo, no, I\'m not.\n3\nOh, well, what do what is it you want to?\n3\nHow do you how are you gonna get from Edinburgh to Glasgow?\n3\nWell, I was going to fly.\n3\nFly alright, hang on a moment.\n3\nSo we\'ve got [name]’s marquee.\n3\nWe\'ve got a a named extent.\n3\nNow we\'ve got A to B.\n3\nUM and now I need you to specify A to B, but also I need you to say that you want to fly. So, so now \nwe\'re focusing towards a more task based activity.\n3\nWell, these are all perfectly valid ways of interface, but we can immediately see the complexity that is \nunravelling really quickly.\n3\nReally, we\'ve just looked at some really simple examples.\n3\nOhh and I didn\'t add this one in as well.\n3\nJust buying it typing in.\n3\nCoordinates. So you.\n3\nCould have you can type in coordinates.\n3\nYou can use [name]’s marquee graphical user interface.\n3\nWe can use named extent or we can use A to B.\n3\nAnd presumably each of these interfaces is going to require different levels of functionality, different \nlevels of knowledge and understanding of what you\'re trying to do.\n3\nSo which of these would be most appropriate if I wanted to go?\n3\nFrom Edinburgh to Glasgow.\n3\nIf I wants to fly from Edinburgh to Glasgow then maybe none of these ideas are any use to us.\n3\nI just need to know how often the planes fly from.\n3\nEdinburgh to Glasgow.\n1\nAre you seriously?\n3\nAnd I\'m actually only interested in a map that gets me from here to the airport.\n3\nI\'m not interested in a map between here and Glasgow.\n1\nSo that\'s the problem with focusing on the user needs.\n3\nThere I might this office must.\n3\nBe full of books.\n3\nOn on interface design I\'m trying to.\n3\nThink you know the the notion of affordance and ideas of interface design has been around for a very, \nvery long time.\n3\nI can\'t see any.\n3\nThey\'re probably over there.\n3\nSo, so so I think graph the design of interfaces is a fascinating topic.\n3\nHow you go about?\n3\nIt is, is is also very difficult.\n3\nIf you try and accommodate every type of possible user that might use the system, then I think it \nbecomes inordinately complex.\n3\nI think you\'re better off saying before you use digimap.\n3\nWatch this 25 minute video by [name] and he in the video he explains to you the basic.\n3\nConcepts or underlying it? He gives you an introduction to maps and how they are used and designed \nand explains why you need to have an understanding of scale and of thematic use. And once you\'ve \nwatched his 25 minute video, you\'ll be able to use the.\n3\nDid you map into phase two?\n3\nHe he will pose a set of questions that.\n3\nHi, Edward.\n3\nYeah, I\'m just in a meeting.\n3\nAm I able?\n3\nTo call you back in 5-10.\n3\nMinutes. Thanks evid. Bye bye.\n3\nI\'m not trying to.\n3\nI would not dream to try and persuade you not to do what you\'re doing, that I it it it just.\n3\nI I think it\'s a really important thing to scope.\n3\nExercise because I don\'t think it\'s meaningful to say or we\'re going to design an interface that will.\n3\nEverybody because we\'ve got.\n3\nOur astronaut problem.\n3\nAnd we\'ve also got, you know, most people do have have arms.\n3\nAnd so.\n3\nSo the idea of designing A pedal operated filing cabinet.\n3\nWell, nobody\'s gonna use that functionality.\n1\nI see I.\n3\nSo I think it\'s about narrowing it down.\n3\nIt\'s about understanding the the tasks more than it is understanding whether.\n3\nIt\'s a teacher.\n3\nA epidemic or a pro?\n3\nI think it\'s about saying or commercial.\n3\nSorry organization.\n3\nI think it\'s about, it\'s about understanding the nature of the task and then thinking thinking through \nwhat are the functional requirements to support that task.\n3\nSo the task is to.\n3\nBe able to open that door in order to get through it.\n3\nThe affordance or the functionality that enables you to open that door is afforded through the handle, \nso a handle it becomes an integral part of the door because it\'s the mechanism by which you\'re able to \nuse it.\n3\nSo I think that\'s the way to think about the problem I see rather than thinking about, well, who\'s going \nto come through that door.\n2\nRight.\n3\nIt\'s about the notion of what it is that you want the door to do, and it\'s to.\n3\nOne of its functions it\'s to prevent fire spreading.\n3\nIt\'s to prevent gives some privacy, and it also needs to be something you can open and close.\n3\nOhh, and in the interests of security we can lock it.\n3\nAnd so that door does all of those things.\n3\nIt\'s pretty amazing.\n3\nIt\'s got a self closure on the top to make the door actually close fire.\n3\nIt\'s got glass so that you don\'t open the door just as somebody\'s coming in and you bump into each \nother, it\'s got a lock and.\n3\nIt\'s got a handle.\n3\nAnd it takes 2 hours for the fire.\n3\nTo burn through it.\n3\nAnd so these are all.\n3\nAffordances or design that relate to the functionality of to what it is you\'re trying to.\n3\nDo so. That\'s.\n1\nOK, I see.\n3\nHow I would look at it?\n1\nSo ultimately I think drawing it back to like the practical point for you and for your PhD student, the \nultimate task, it needs to do is to download data for later analysis.\n3\nThat\'s right.\n3\nI\'m just asking it to be a filing cabinet.\n3\nWith with a normal conventional handle for the, you know, I know, I know all about filing cabinets and \nhow they work for somebody that looks at that.\n\nI see.\n3\nAnd goes. What is that?\n3\nThen they need to.\n3\nWatch the video.\n3\nOr maybe you made the filing cabinet out of glass so they can see what\'s in it without thinking.\n3\nIs it what?\n3\nWhat sort of thing is it so?\n3\nYeah, I.\n3\nSo you can ask your user community but I think ohh I can see a book there called human computer \ninteraction and there must be no there must be loads of.\n1\nOh, nice.\n3\nBooks that.\n3\nThat\'s that\'s a kind of.\n3\nThe that\'s a key text that.\n3\nThat book, but there are loads of others.\n3\nNorman and Carol have written amazing stuff on on interface design.\n3\nSo yeah, it\'s I think it\'s about us.\n3\nYes, I\'m not saying throw away your user, but it\'s about understanding the nature of their task.\n3\nI think that gives greater insight than necessarily saying, oh, we\'ve got teachers, we\'ve got academics, \nwe\'ve got.\n1\nI see.\n1\nI see.\n1\nOK.\n1\nYes, yes, it\'s so helpful.\n1\nYes, thank you.\n3\nMuch what\'s nice about these discussions is that of course, like all good things in academia, you can \neither choose to do something with those ideas, or you can just quietly throw them away and nobody\'s \never offended or upset by that.\n3\nSo that\'s fine.\n1\nAll right.\n1\nThank you so much for.\n2\nMeeting with me.\n3\nWell, enjoy."'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'The transcript summarizer is working on the user experience side of Digimap. They are trying to identify different user groups and their goals in terms of using the software. They have looked at the log analysis part and are trying to gather insights from actual users about their experience and functionality they mainly use. They are also interested in the practical use of Digimap, rather than research academic ways. They rarely use Digimap themselves, except for a specific project with a PhD student. They view Digimap as a filing cabinet that contains different data types and levels of detail. They mention that Digimap does not offer much analysis functionality and that it is better to use other software like ArcGIS for analysis. They also discuss the challenges of designing an intuitive interface for Digimap and the trade-off between simplicity and functionality.
